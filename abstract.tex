A search is presented for decays of $\cPZ$ and Higgs bosons to a $\JPsi$ meson and a photon, with the subsequent decay of the $\JPsi$ to $\MM$. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The observed limit on the $\cPZ\to\JPsi\gamma$ decay branching fraction, assuming that the $\JPsi$ meson is produced unpolarized, is $1.4\times10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level, which corresponds to a rate higher than expected in the standard model by a factor of 15. For extreme-polarization scenarios, the observed limit changes from -13.6 to +8.6\% with respect to the unpolarized scenario. The observed upper limit on the branching fraction for $\PH\to\JPsi\gamma$ where the $\JPsi$ meson is assumed to be transversely polarized is $7.6\times 10^{-4}$, a factor of 260 larger than the standard model prediction. The results for the Higgs boson are combined with previous data from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ to produce an observed upper limit on the branching fraction for $\PH\to\JPsi\gamma$ that is a factor of 220 larger than the standard model value.
