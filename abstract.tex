A search for decays of $\cPZ$ and Higgs bosons to a $\JPsi$ meson and a photon, with the subsequent decay of the $\JPsi$ to $\MM$, is presented. The analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The observed (expected) upper limit on the $\cPZ\to\JPsi\ \gamma$ decay branching fraction, assuming that the $\JPsi$ is produced unpolarized, is $1.4\ (1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.5})\times10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level, which corresponds to 15 (18) times the standard model prediction. The subscript and superscript stand for the range of 68\% central quantiles of upper limits with background-only hypothesis. For the extreme polarization scenarios the observed (expected) limit varies from -13.6 (-13.5) to +8.6 (+8.2)\%. The observed (expected) upper limit on the branching fraction for $\PH\to\JPsi\ \gamma$ with $m_{\PH} = 125\GeV$ is $7.6\ (5.2^{+2.4}_{-1.6})\times 10^{-4}$, 260 (170) times the standard model prediction, at 95\% confidence level. The $\JPsi$ meson from the Higgs boson decay is assumed to be fully transversely polarized. The results for the Higgs boson decay are combined with the results from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\TeV$ corresponding to 19.7\fbinv, and this yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the branching fraction for $\PH\to\JPsi\ \gamma$ of 220 (160) times the standard model prediction.
